## Professional Summary (3 lines)

Data scientist and AI engineer with hands-on experience building reproducible, institution-grade analytics and machine learning systems.
Built end-to-end pipelines spanning data engineering, model development, evaluation rigor, drift/quality monitoring, and operational dashboards.
Demonstrates research-oriented experimentation discipline, offline documentation practices, and audit-ready artifact generation.

## CV Bullet Snippets (6–8 total)

- Junior Data Scientist: Built and evaluated imbalanced-classification pipelines with reproducible configs, stratified splits, threshold calibration, and clear performance reporting.
- Junior Data Scientist: Produced explainability outputs (SHAP, confusion matrices, ROC curves) and translated findings into plain-language stakeholder summaries.
- AI Engineer: Implemented config-driven ML training and advanced tuning workflows (Optuna + XGBoost) with deterministic seeds and persistent model/report artifacts.
- AI Engineer: Developed an operational anomaly detection service integrating validation, inference, drift checks, logging, and FastAPI endpoints.
- Data Engineer: Created PostgreSQL-ready schema/ingestion/query scripts with constraints, indexing, and quality gates for institutional-style data pipelines.
- Data Engineer: Added structured JSONL logging and reproducible quality reports for auditability and incident-review workflows.
- Research Engineer: Built a decentralized MARL + XGBoost experimentation framework with topology-aware communication, trust-weighted aggregation, and per-round metrics logging.
- Research Engineer: Implemented repeated parameter studies with significance testing, boxplots/parameter curves, and executive/research summaries suitable for technical review.
